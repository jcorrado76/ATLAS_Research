This macro will fill histograms of the zerobias MET data, as well as create the
efficiency of L1 XE 30.

This is the first stage of the corrections. The efficiency objects created from
this macro are used to correct the L1XE30 data back to the zerobias data

It writes the non-normalized MET distributions to file, as well as the
efficiency objects, and the efficiency fits
