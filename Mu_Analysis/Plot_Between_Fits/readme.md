This project will take the fits to the efficiency curves, and the efficiency
curves as computed from the data, and will plot them both on the same plot.
Generating 7 plots; one for each mu bin. As for the fits, I will plot two
functions generated from each of the fits by taking the parameters in the fits,
and plotting a version of the function where the parameters are appended by the
uncertainty, and another version where the parameters are subtracted off by the
uncertainty. Hopefully I can find an option to fill between these two curves
with some alpha value so I can overlay the data points for the efficiency in
between each of the fits.
