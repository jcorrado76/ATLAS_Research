  [ ] get the associated fit TF1 functions
  [ ] then use them to evaluate in the correct weight function

Plot Against zerobias distributions
  [ ] Edit the plot MET distributions macro to plot the zerobias MET
distributions by adding a functionality to write the distributions to file
  [ ] Read the zerobias met distributions from file
  [ ] plot the zerobias met distributions on the same plots as the corrected met
