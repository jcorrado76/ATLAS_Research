		Firstly, I would like to thank my principal investigator, Allen, for always being available to answer my questions, and to have seemingly infinite patience when I try to dig deep into my understanding of our research. 

		In addition, I would like to thank my dear friend and colleague, Don, for always being there for me, and specifically for always being immensely helpful whenever I wanted to bounce off any questions for my understanding and how to solve problems in our research.
