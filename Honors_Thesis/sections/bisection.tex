\section{Efficiency Curves}
An efficiency curve illustrates the probability of an algorithm to classify the MET of an event as above or below a threshold value as a function of the MET as determined by another, ``true'' algorithm. 
So we can ask, what is the efficiency of L1 $> 30$ as a function of CELL MET. What this is means is we are taking the MET as determined by CELL to be the true MET, and we want to know how well (what the probability is) L1 does at classifying events as having MET above or below $30$ at each value of the MET determined by CELL. 
The way one would read a plot of this efficiency is to pick a value of CELL MET ( on the x-axis ) and ask ``of the number of events CELL determined had this MET, what fraction did L1 determine had MET greater than the threshold [30 GeV]''. 
The fraction [of the total amount of events CELL determined was in that MET bin] that L1 determined was greater than the threshold would be the height of the efficiency curve at that value of CELL MET.
A perfect efficiency curve would look like a step function centered at the threshold around which one is trying to classify the MET of events. 
The fact that efficiency curves in reality do not look like step functions can be understood in terms of Type I and Type II error. 
The step function for the efficiency curve would be centered on the threshold one is asking for the efficiency about. 
The fact that the efficiency curve immediately to the left of the threshold is not zero means that, of the events CELL determined had MET lower than the threshold, L1 determined some fraction of those events had an MET higher than the threshold. 
The fact that the efficiency curve immediately to the right of the threshold is not one means that, of the events CELL said had MET larger than the threshold, L1 said some fraction of those events had MET lower than the threshold. 
In this case, the fraction of events L1 determined had an MET higher than the threshold, given that CELL said the MET was higher than the threshold, is less than one.
\section{Improving Efficiency Using Combined Algorithms}
In this assignment, we wanted to see if we could obtain an increase in efficiency by combining uncorrelated algorithms together subject to the constraint of the trigger rate. The issue is that there are many pairs of thresholds that when combine will keep the proper trigger rate. In the parameter space of all possible combinations of combined thresholds, we have two degrees of freedom in determining what the appropriate thresholds on a pair of algorithms should be. 
In order to simplify the problem, I imposed the constraint that the two trigger rates for the algorithms had to be the same. Therefore, I removed a degree of freedom in the parameter space by constraining my solution space to pairs of thresholds that satisfy the trigger rate and lie on the line $y=x$. The monotonicty of the fraction of events kept as you change either of the thresholds on the algorithms guarantees that there will be a unique solution to both of these constraints on the parameter space. \\
Once we added the constraint of keeping the same fraction individually, the problem essentially became one-dimensional, and I used the popular bisection root-finding method in order to compute the solution to the optimal pair of thresholds. \\
This consisted of guessing an individual fraction for each of the algorithms to keep, and then computing what the combined fraction of events kept was. We iterated this process until the combined fraction kept matched the trigger rate to within one bin.
The level curve describing the set of pairs of thresholds such that the trigger rate constraint is satisfied is given by the constraint:
$$f(\tau_{\alpha},\tau_{\beta})=C$$
for some $C$. Here, $f$ is the function representing the fraction of events kept when the algorithms are used together at the same time. 
In order to compute $C$, we used the fraction of passnoalg data that passed an L1 MET cut of $50$ GeV and a CELL MET cut of $100$ GeV. 
For our analysis, $C$ turned out to be $0.0059$.
So we needed to solve the equation $f(\tau_{\alpha},\tau_{\beta})=0.0059$. 
However, because the parameter space is two-dimensional, and the evaluation of $f$ takes a long time (fraction of events kept by both algorithms, and by each one individually), we introduced the constraint that the two individual fractions kept needed to be the same.
\subsection{Transverse Mass Cut}
In addition to the cuts on the various algorithms, we also needed to introduce a cut on the transverse mass that is detected to ensure we only keep events with a transverse mass close to that of the W boson ($80.379\pm 0.012 GeV/c^2$). 
We compute the transverse mass using:
$$m_{T}=\sqrt{2P_{\mu}P_{\nu}(1+\cos{(\phi)})}$$
In addition to the aforementioned cuts, we also added a cut on the transverse mass for the range $40 \leq m_{T} \leq 100$.
