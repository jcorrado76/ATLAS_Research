Questions I have for my thesis advisor

1. How many of the plots should I include, and where do I include them?
2. How much code do I include. Can I just include a link to my github?
3. Is my theory section strong enough? Where should I make it more substantial
4. Why do we want to select events that are W rich? Implies higher MET?
5.
