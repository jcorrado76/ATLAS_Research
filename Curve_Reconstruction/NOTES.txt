When you are trying to scale a histogram, use:{{{

hist->Scale(8);
It is faster, as operator* creates a temporary copy of the whole histogram
}}}
There are two pictures here. There is the picture where I determine the
efficiency of the ZeroBias data that also passes XE20 to just the ZeroBias data.
Then there is the picture of the different passnoalg plots, which we want to
correct in each bin by the corresponding ratio from the efficiency, so that it
looks like the zerobias data
