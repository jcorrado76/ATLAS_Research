The left hand side of this picture is the histograms of the energy for metcell
if passrndm on zerobias data either with the L1>20 cut (XE20) or without. The
one without the cut is obviously the higher one, as it kept more events. 

The right hand side of this picture is the efficiency curve of the XE20 cut on
metcell, as a function of zerobias metcell. 

The right hand side looks hazy at higher energies as a result of already not
having enough statistics to compute the efficiency properly.
