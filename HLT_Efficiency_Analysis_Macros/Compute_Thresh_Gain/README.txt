This macro will determine how much in trigger rate we gain by using two
algorithms instead of one. 

Take the best of the two algorithms indvidiually, and compute where the
efficiency curve is at %50.

Then, find where the combined fractions for the algs needs to be in order to
have the same %50 point in efficiency. 

This difference in fraction is how much we gain by using two algorithms.
