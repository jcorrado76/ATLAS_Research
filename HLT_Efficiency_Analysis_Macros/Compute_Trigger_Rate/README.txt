This macro determines the trigger rate to be used for the determination of the
thresholds. 

This macro takes the settings being used at CERN in order to compute the
fraction of HLT events kept to the number of process1 events. 

This rate is the constraint for the bisection algorithm in how many events one
can keep between the two algorithms
